# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as either dogs or cats. The dataset used is the popular Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle. This classifier is developed and tested using a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab, leveraging the convenience of Colab's GPU.

## Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle:
- [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

## Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of Python, TensorFlow, and neural networks
- Access to the internet

## Setting Up
1. **Google Colab Setup:**
   - Open Google Colab and connect to your Google Drive.
   - Upload the `kaggle.json` file (which contains your Kaggle API credentials) to your Google Drive.

2. **Download and Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Run the notebook cells provided to download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it.
   - The dataset is divided into a training set and a validation set automatically.

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - TensorFlow (already included in Colab)
   - OpenCV for Python (`opencv-python`)
   - Matplotlib (for plotting training results)

## Model Architecture
The model consists of:
- Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.
- Batch normalization applied after each convolutional operation to stabilize learning.
- Two dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.
- A final output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Running the Code
- Run the Jupyter notebook cells in sequence.
- Training process visualization is provided through Matplotlib plots showing training and validation accuracy and loss.

## Testing the Model
- Use OpenCV to load and preprocess any test image of a cat or a dog.
- The model can predict whether the image is a cat or a dog based on the trained classifier.

## Further Improvements
- Implement data augmentation to enhance model generalizability.
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Utilize advanced techniques like transfer learning.
